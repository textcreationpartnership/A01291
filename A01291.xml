            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2844:4"/> that some ioint discourse might be made of these three excellent lawes, whereby the agreement and disagreement of them, and the grounds, and reasons therof might euidently appeare by some very skilfull in these Lawes well grounded, and if it might be, which I neuer yet saw, professed in the same: and in such a plentiful haruest of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing wits in this land, which are adorned with great varietie of reading, as the firmament with diuersitie of starres, I could not but expect the euent of so good a thing: yet in the end, when I saw many daies ouerpasse, and slide away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the successe of my desire, taking my wish to bee somewhat more, then <hi>Vigilantis somnium;</hi> I thought it better to make some trial of my slēder abilitie, to put my wishe in practise, &amp; to lay that heauie burden vpon mine own feeble shoulders, then that such a profitable thing should be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether frustrate of attempt, howsoeuer voide of effect: by that meane (if it might be) to excite, and stirre vp some other, <hi>quem Musae comitantur &amp; artes,</hi> to vndertake this taske, and farre more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudiciously, and learnedly to accomplish this busines. For I remember the saying of D. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus,</hi> a principall author in the Ciuill Lawe, that those things, which are not very well inuented, yet may bee profitable in this respect, because they may perhaps prouoke others to the inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the truth<note n="c" place="margin">Prosunt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus recte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitata, cum alios incitent, saltem ad veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:2844:4"/> therof, all cōmon weales, which are growne to hight and preheminence, haue had their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous rising, their abundant increase, and their fortunate continuance; but by the want, breach, or chaunge of good Lawes, nothing hath insued but the desolation, downefall, and ineuitable ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of many dominions, and estates. Not to tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your patience with instances of pettie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, and inferiour regiments, by your fauours let the foure most eminēt common weales of the world be tried by this touchstone, and let my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion by their destinated courses bee measured and examined; The foure common weales I speake of, were the <hi>Cretensian, Athenian, Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> estates: the first was of all these the formost and most auncient, famosed by the lawes of <hi>Minos,</hi> who so studiously imployed his paines in the making and amending of lawes for the space of nine yeares together, that this Common weale being well setled, was well fenced against future mishaps, and continued in great prosperitie till the Romanes grewe too strong: The <hi>Athenian</hi> Common weale was first guided by <hi>Dracoes</hi> Lawes, written not with inke, but with bloud, rather terrours then rules of estate: wherfore these for their too great asperity being cancelled, and antiquated, <hi>Solon</hi> that sage Father, being (contrarie to the foolish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe or rather by-woord) both a great Clerke, and an excellent wise man, and hauing the whole administration of that estate committed to his handes did enact, and establishe Lawes
<pb facs="tcp:2844:5"/> with such moderation, and equitie, that the greatest parte of the Lawe called the Lawes of of the xij. Tables, that absolute president, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy platforme of all Iustice (to the full opening and cleare expoūding, of which it might bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that some very learned man would put to his painefull hand) are said to be the fruite and issue of his deep, and peereles iudgement. The Lacedemonian common weale was established by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that famous lawemaker, by whose profitable directions &amp; ordinances that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale did for the space of sixe hundred yeeres exceedingly flourishe in equitie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but when the neglect of these Lawes had entred and pearced into the body of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and wantonesse, licentiousnes and desire of money had encroched into the place of these commodious orders, they lost their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme with their libertie, and the deformitie of mens manners did wholy disfigure the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and decent proportion of that goodlie Common weale. Now I come by your fauour to the Romaine estate, that is, to the miracle of miracles (if any humane thing may beare so gorgious a title) surpassing farre her predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours in greatnes, happines, and continuance of time: the cause of which rare felicitie is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth, then the prescript of good Lawes, made by <hi>Numa,</hi> and others, howsoeuer some partially affected, do as their seuerall fansies led the, ascribe &amp; attribut the same to seueral causes, whose censures &amp; opiniōs giue me leaue by your

Our greatest law-makers in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times were <hi>Ina, Alured, Guthran, Edward, Ethelstane, Edmund, Edgar, Ethelred, Canutus:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their raignes ended, and their lawes establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; K. <hi>Edward</hi> the confessor (after his inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the throne of England) finding in the garden of the Common-weale, some lawes like to weeds, others like to flowers; as a diligent Bee he extracted a good iuice out of the better laws, and the worser by him neglected, by difusing wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour hauing wholly subdued this realme, perceiuing that his subiects did with great applause fauour the laws of King <hi>Edward:</hi> yet seeing in them somewhat which himselfe and others in politike considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion disliked, imitating the frugall houswife, who knoweth that the best hony cannot be good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be clarified and refined, singled out twelue persons out of euery shire (imitating perhaps the Romanes, who appointed <hi>decemuirs</hi> for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their laws:) Men of approued skill &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, who might by exploration seuer the dross from the gold, and the erronious lawes from the conuenient and commodious,<note n="c" place="margin">Lambard. lib archaeon.</note> adding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto some customes of Normandy,<note n="d" place="margin">Lib. des cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes de Norman.</note> whereof many, for the reasonablenes of thē, haue to this day continued.

First, because it so agreeth with the law, religion, and discipline of the holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and true Church of Christ, that there is nothing in it which to the Law of God is crosse or opposite. Secondly, because other nations with whom wee haue commerce, &amp; entercourse, doe not find their commodities or liberties to be impeached by this Lawe. Thirdly, because they are rather popular, then peremptorie, rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, then exacted, and rather embraced, then perswaded. And with this I conclude, leauing these lawes to your further and more considerate commendation.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2844:12"/> set downe certain rules, &amp; as it were, a good platforme of the exercise. The rules were but 2. in nūber, which were great in weight. 1. He willed thē to exclude all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuillng, to yeeld vnto the better reason, and with ioint indeuor to search out the truth of euery matter proposed: for he said that <hi>nimiùm altercando amittitur veritas.</hi> 2. Hee would not (sithence comparisons wer of al things most saucy and malepert) that they should enter into any disdainful compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the lawes which they professed, but should rather vse them as brethren, then as enemies, &amp; should reuerence the greatnes of knowledge, where they found it, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the weaknes when they had discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, without bitternesse of tongue or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of heart, assuring themselues that the meanest of these lawes might in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things profite the greatest of these Lawyers: for as he obserued the sayings &amp; doings of <hi>Cato</hi> in stead of a Law, so one of <hi>Catoes</hi> sententious and iudicious oracles he had alwaies in his mouth. <hi>Alienā artē temerè ne contēnito:</hi> hauing by these rules as by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits bounded the order &amp; maner of their
<pb facs="tcp:2844:12"/> conference, he proposed certain things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, &amp; in order to be discussed, which were thus by him marshalled. Because in raūge of all humane affaires subiect to the contēplation of law, contracts haue frō an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time bin the ground of vesting &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the property of things, hee would therfore first haue thē to begin with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of cōtracts: &amp; because there be two things following after cōtracts concluded much in vse, namely, 1. a gift or graunt; 2. a bargain or sale, he would therefore of these two haue thē diligētly to argue: &amp; because gifts haue bin often made to raise &amp; create a tenure, his desire was that in the 4. place they should discourse of Seignories and seruices: &amp; for that grants or gifts be made sometime ioyntly, or by moities, he would haue them to speake somewhat of ioynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or tenants in common: and because they that haue things by gift &amp; grant doe often exchange them, his minde was they should handle the nature &amp; manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, and sithence the last disposing of all worldly things is by the last will &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of the party, he therfore requested
<pb facs="tcp:2844:13"/> them to be painfull herein: after as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cōueiances of lāds, which be in the realty he would haue them to proceed to personal things, as namely to treat of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and lending, and of the bailement or deliuery of goods and chattels: because such things were much in vse. And because these and the precedent matters were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times occasions of action, therefore he thought it conuenient that they should speake somewhat of the forme and maner of ordinary proceeding in matters of law, and when they had finished this taske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid, hee prayed them to discourse of penall and criminall matters, of common trespasses and wrongs, and other offences against the peace, the order of which hee would hereafter set downe. The method of their conference being thus digested, and respit of studie and deliberation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> thus spake to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicgnostes.</hi>

                     <p>Because in euery controuersie of law, there must be a plaintife and a defendant, it is not amisse nor impertinent to mention such things as ought to be obserued &amp; regarded of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife, when he draweth any man into suit: and they are three in number, the one concerning profit, the other necessitie, and the third vrbanitie.

                     <p>These cautels which your law prescribeth to such as enter into suit,<note place="margin">3. The cautels to be obserued at the commō law in the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of an action.</note> are not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiected of our law, for as to the two first which concerne profit &amp; necessity, our law doth rigorously exact them: as to the other it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, for it doth not forbid, nor hinder any man to bee courteous to another, but it being a science rather politike then mortall, doth more respect the Iustice of causes, then the courteous gestures of men, our law doth vrge men to deale well and honestly, &amp; if they do otherwise it doth punish thē, but curtesie is a free, spontaneal &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious quality, to which no inforcement may be vsed, but I will first examine by your patience, how farre forth our law regardeth the abilitie of the person, which is to impleade another, and then by course will examine all the partes of your precedent speech, inquiring by our bookes howe they may sort, and be sutable to our law. First it hath beene receiued of vs as a currant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2844:74"/> rule from all antiquity,<note place="margin">4. Disablemēts in the person of the plaintife at the common law.</note> that the defendant may pleade outlawrie in disablement of the plaintife, but if he doe imparle now he cannot plead out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawrie to the disablement of his person, but yet he may well pleade it in barre of the action,<note n="n" place="margin">32.

H. 6. 36.</note> so in a Writ brought by one as sonne and heire to I.S. after imparlance the tenant cannot pleade to the Writte that hee is bastarde, or that hee is not heire, but hee may very well pleade it in barre of the action,<note n="o" place="margin">22. E. 4. 35.</note> and so outlawrie is a good plea in barre of an Action of Debt: for by the outlawrie of the plaintife, the debt if it growe by especialtie is vested in the Queene, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is of an action of debt vpon a contract:<note n="p" place="margin">16. E. 4. 4.</note> for in that case the debtor might wage his lawe against the debtee who is outlawed, and as it seemeth by 10. Henr. 7. the outlawrie goeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in barre of the Action, then to the Writ, for there it is saide, that where a man cannot pleade to the Writ, but by shewing of a matter in barre, there hee may shewe it and conclude to the writ: for in an action of debt a man may pleade outlawrie in the plaintife, and conclude to the person, and yet the matter goeth in barre, and hee may pleade it also in barre,<note n="q" place="margin">10. H. 7. 11.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to the action, and after that a voucher is counterpleaded, and the tenaunt put to another aunswere, hee may notwithstanding plead that the demaundaunt is outlawed,<note n="r" place="margin">21. E. 4. 64.</note> but after vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher the tenaunt may not plead to the fourme of the Writte,<note n="s" place="margin">5. E. 3. 223.</note> and 32. Henr. 6. is verie plaine, that where a man pleadeth that the plaintife is
<pb facs="tcp:2844:75"/> an alien borne, or a villaine, or an outlawed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is left to his choise, whether hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude these speciall matters to the writ or to the action,<note n="t" place="margin">32. H. 6. 27.</note> and though the defendant haue made an atturney in a repleuin, yet hee may afterward alledge that the plaintife is his villaine,<note n="u" place="margin">29. E. 3. 24.</note> So 21. Rich. 2. in Assise brought by the husbande and wife against diuerse persons, the tenaunts sayd that the wife of the plaintife was entred into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the house of B. and there was a Nun professed, &amp; demanded iudgement if she should be aunswered, and the Assise was adiourned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common place, and a writ was sent to the Bishop to certifie, who certified that shee was professed, wherefore the defendants prayed that the husband and wife might bee barred for euer, and it was helde by the whole Court, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the plea did stretch onely to disable the wife of the plaintife, and if the husbande and wife had purchast ioyntly, that the baron should notwithstanding the disablement haue an Assise of the whole, but otherwise it is if the husbande and wife bring an Assise, and a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or release of the husbande or the wife or of some auncestour of one of them bee pleaded in barre, both of them shall bee barred, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this case it was helde that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to bee that the husband should be barred, but by the aduise of the whole Court it was awarded that the husbande and the wife <hi>nihil capiant per breue suum, sed essent in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia.</hi>

                     <p>That is both true and possible,<note place="margin">15 Alciate his said opinion is confronted by the authoritie of Bodinus.</note> as against <hi>Alciat,</hi> and other writers strangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited in this point, <hi>Bodinus</hi> hath largely and learnedly disputed. <hi>Alciat</hi> denieth it to be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that naturally bodies, which are said to meet in places far distant, should at the naming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus vanishe into the ayre, and be carried swiftly and inuisibly thether, but this is possible enough: For if the spirits can not in a moment withdraw the sight of things, surely they can do verie little: for this is many waies done, and iuggelers and professors of feates can performe it, and as to the swift transporting of them to remote places, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus</hi> reasoneth well; that if the Spirit of the eight Sphaere of the heauens, doe mooue a thing of so great compasse and quantity in so short a space, that in one howre it passeth aboue a hundred times an hundred miles, why may not a wicked spirit carrie the small bodies of such witches in the minute of an howre, the space of a hundred or two hundred miles: yet I do not thinke it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible which some affirme, that the bodies of such witches may pierce through a chinke or riffe of a wall (for the nature of the body cannot be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2844:113"/> but this seemeth rather to be an illusion of the diuell offered to witches: but what of this? suppose that a witch doe confesse vnto a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that she went in by a riffe of the wall to kill a child, which shee kild, because it is not possible that the witch should passe through such a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row creuise, shall the Magistrate therefor absolue the witch, as guiltlesse of the childs death? Nay rather let him diuide the matter, and seuer that which is impossible, from that which may be, namely the passing through the riffe of the wall, from the killing of the child: for it may bee, that in truth the diuell brought her in at the doore to kill the child, though he made it seeme to her that she came in at a chinke of the wall: but surely if there were no other fault in witches, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of God, and the abiuring of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet this being in it selfe consummat apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, doth deserue extreame punishment, and whosoeuer thinketh that witches, because for the most part, they be sottish, old, and doting, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie easily deceiued, and therefore ought to bee spared, hee is in a greate error, for malice driueth them to desire that, which by the diuels meanes they compasse; when they haue obteyned it, their froward nature doth ioy in it, and the diuell for the most part leaueth them, before they leaue him.</p>

                     <p>Indeed so it seemeth: for when they fall into the handes of Iustice, and bee cast into close prison, the diuell commonly practiseth no
<pb facs="tcp:2844:114"/> more feates for them, but suffereth them to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine the punishment of law without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling for them: but I haue much wondred what should be the cause of this.</p>

                     <p>That is done for two causes. First,<note place="margin">16 A double reason is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged wherefore the diuel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not for witches after that they be imprisoned.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the diuell seeketh nothing more desirously then the gaine of their soules: for when he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the soule is wholly brought vnder his power, he expecteth for nothing so greedily, as the departure of the soule from the bodie, that he may torment the soule, which before the death of the party he doth <hi>retinere subpacto,</hi> and he not only laboureth, but hasteneth his death as much as he can, least repentance (God is the God of mercy) doe deliuer the miserable caytife out of the snare of damnation:<note n="q" place="margin">c.

<pb facs="tcp:2844:130"/> their frendly speeches, &amp; careles in refusing so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a taske, though to me importable, as being the club of <hi>Hercules</hi> laid vpon the sholders of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> I haue again aduentured vpon this cumber some prouince, and drawne other furrowes in this stony soile: and as I haue continued the worke, so haue I continued the dedication thereof in all constant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance to your Lordship, whose regardfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance toward me hath merited more at my hands then such worthlesse paines, rather by the trauaile of my pen, and the practicke of my contemplation, to publish and notifie to the worlde my dutifull thankfull and zealefull affection toward your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces person, then by the vnfeatured lumpe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned bearewhelpe of my misconceyuing, &amp; miscarying endeuour, to platforme a consummate and exemplarie Parallele or Trinomion, which is an obiect to be aymed at, and a pray to be pursued; not of the Stonegall, the Muskette, and the Merlin, but of the Eagle, the Goshauke, and other birdes of an higher wing, and more surmounting flight: and for the accomplishment thereof it were to be wished, that God would vouchsafe our Innes of Court with some second <hi>Budaeus,</hi> that is a third <hi>Varro,</hi> whose skill in the lawes might bee exquisite, whose paines extreme, whose reward excellent: for mine owne parte though I bee rather a rash then a voluntarie soldier in this campe, yet I am bound by conscience not to eate the bread of idlenes, to do for my country what I can, and to labour in my calling as I may.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Omomathes,</hi> when the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the three Lawes was finished, gaue himselfe to his recreation, which was the hunting of the Bucke, an exercise commendable for Gentlemen, and vsed in auncient time of them, whose high estates had entitled them with the names of <hi>Heroes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Semidei.</hi> But when winter began to shed his cold influence, and to replenish the aire with congealing vapours, to make the earth as it were a naked beldam, and to cause the dugges of the sea to swell with surg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing billowes, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> retired to his bookes, and gaue a farewel to the fields, betrothing himselfe that winter to his studie. And because the iuice of the late conference of the Lawes had turned to good bloud in his mind, he meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the conference, of which he had a more strict regard then of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
<pb facs="tcp:2844:131"/> For when it was rumord in the countrie where <hi>Nomomathes</hi> dwelt, that such a conference was had: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward certain copies were dispersed, and diuulgated, some were wel pleased, some were discontented with the Dialogues: <hi>Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli.</hi> Amongst the rest that were discontēted was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a plaine countrie man, and a gentle man not vnlearned, who when they had heard, that <hi>Nomomathes</hi> meant to reuiue and recontinue the conference, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to go to his house, and to open their mindes as they conceiued of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Their purpose they followed, and to the house they came, where beeing kindly and curteouslie entertained of <hi>Nomomathes,</hi> and in their by-talke glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the Dialogues: <hi>Nomomathes</hi> willed them to spare no speech, and professed that hee would willinglie admit their censures, and that he would heare them in order: They seeing his patience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, deliuered in few words their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conceits. And first the gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:2844:132"/> tooke exception to the discourses of <hi>Codicgnostes:</hi> for that he in the first Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, discussing matters of common weale, and of the Ciuill Law, did forget to handle verie important matters, and to his profession not impertinent. The first was because hee did not treat of Dettes, a thing in the Ciuill Law not omitted: and yet in no Law sufficiently debated. Secondly, he speaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Accompts or reckonings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that is a large and frequent title in the Ciuill Law. Lastly speaking <hi>ex professo</hi> of the originall of Tenures and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices in the fourth Dialogue, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth verie little of Conditions, which verie often are the constituent causes of these Seruices: With this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and then spake the Parson, who did expostulate with the <hi>Canonist</hi> some iniuries, because the Canon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so full and pregnant in matter of Tythe, hee did not vouchsafe to speake anie one woord of Tythes: And whereas we haue Parsons said he,
<pb facs="tcp:2844:132"/> haue much impediment by <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and many times wrong, when they come to triall: for the countrie people which are the Iurors, who haue no more desire to paie their Tythes, then the Diuel hath to lose his entercourse with the seauen deadly sinnes; the Pope to be a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and a Beare to go to the stake. If any Prohibition concerning Tythes come to be tried by them, ar as sure to passe against the Parson, as an old chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is sure of blacknes. But let any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come to be tried touching common, which concerneth themselues, and their owne profit, they will as surelie go with the commoner, as the cloudes goe with the Northeast wind: Therefore it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him to be verie conuenient, that because the Canon doth so much fauour Parsons, that therefore the Canonist es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially should haue debated at large of these matters: And he thought the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonist speaking so little of them in the whole discourse, was much troubled with the tooth-ache, (the Canonist here
<pb facs="tcp:2844:133"/> being somewhat cholericke interrupted him, and said he iangled: for he said there were manie thinges proposed in the Dialogues, which the Canon Law neuer medleth with all, neither hath it so much tasted of them, as the dogge licking of <hi>Nilus:</hi> And in some thinges which were in the Dialogues, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law hath nothing els, but which the Ciuill Law hath: so that he should not haue kept <hi>decorum,</hi> but should haue thrust his sicle into the haruest of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicgnostes,</hi> if he should haue encroched vpon such thinges, as the Canon Law hath as it were at the second hand strei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Ciuill. But, said he, as touching Tythes, if any question had been proposed, I would not haue been defectiue in the handling them at large. Then the poore Countrie man made a lowe conge, and <hi>Nomomathes</hi> bowed vnto him, as being willing to heare him. Sir (quoth he) I am by your worships fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour a poore countrie yeoman, dwelling neare a place called <hi>Aitipolis:</hi> and my
<pb facs="tcp:2844:133"/> yeares are more then my knowledge, my patrimonie better then my education, and my hand more nimble then my toong: And I haue had a verie great desire to haue some vnderstanding of Lawe, because I would not swim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame, nor be vnlike vnto my neighbours, who are so full of Law-points, that when they sweat, it is nothing but Law; when they breath, it is nothing but law; when they neese it is perfite law; when they dreame it is profound law. The booke of <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons tenures</hi> is there breakfast, their din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, their boier, their supper, and their rere-banquet: Euerie plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swayne with vs may bee a Seneschall in a Court Baron: Hee can talke of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soines, Vouchers, Withernams, and Recaptions: And if you controll him, the booke of the Groundes of the Law is his portesse, and readie at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to confute you. Surelie sir, my neyghbours are full of sension and tention, and so cunninge, that they
<pb facs="tcp:2844:134"/> will make you beleeue, that all is gold, which glistereth: So that for a man to be amongest them, and to haue lyuing and want Law: is as if a man should haue bread to eate, and want teeth to chew it: Which occasions mooued me at the first to seek for some skill in Law, and amongest other bookes, I bought <hi>The Conference of Law,</hi> whereof hath been spoken, and casting mine eie vpon the diall of common wronges, and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes: I wondered that he which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Common Law, amongest his common wronges and trespasses, he spoke nothing of Wast done in a mans ground: and verie little of an Action vpon the case, which is a wheele much turned about in the place where I dwel. And though hee hath deliuered much of Iointenants, and Tenants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he speaketh either little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Parceners. Now manie of vs countrie people marrie verie often with landed women, and therefore would gladly be seene in that learning.
<pb facs="tcp:2844:134"/> Truely Sir I bought the booke for my more vnderstanding of the law, and for the noueltie, and because it was in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish: yet there is a vengeance deale of Latin in it, which put mee to the cost to buy a <hi>Thomases</hi> Dictionarie, but it is no great matter for that, for it wil serue my sonne <hi>Reginold,</hi> when he shall bee tenne yeares olde, or thereabout: But I pray you sir at the next conference let vs haue somewhat of these matters, which I haue mentioned vnto you: When hee had ceased to speak, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> grauely and with aduise censured their censures, and spoke in this manner. I see now (saide he) the prouerbe to be verified <hi>Quot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines tot sententiae.</hi> there be as many minds as there bee men; And though ye haue deliuered your exceptions in sportfull manner, which as I doe not greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, so I do not greatly delight in, yet I must confesse euerie of them doth flie to the marke, and the blame resteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, who might haue proposed these matters to be discussed; but because the
<pb facs="tcp:2844:135"/> lucre, or losse of the conference, was to redownd wholly to mee in all corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie of reason, and not to others, but by my curtesie: I thought it a more conuenient course, and more free and ingenious to follow the threed of mine owne choise, then the vncertaine winge of popular conceit. Againe, all things cannot be handled at all times, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be intruded into such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which doth not relice to the sū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie palates, and tastes of these seuerall lawes. For many things there be in the common law which hath not any affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with any thing in the ciuill or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. But because your motions are so cōsonant to reason, &amp; so directly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue to your vocations and functions, which in no well ordered cōmon weale ought to be loosely regarded: therfore I protest vnto you in sinceritie, that if all these things, which you haue mētioned may be cast in the molde of a tripartite discourse, the secōd cōferēce shall bring forth that which you haue before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
<pb facs="tcp:2844:135"/> they thanking him for this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse departed, he immediatly questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lawyers, whether they could bring into the compasse of their seuerall reckonings all these matters abouesaid, who anusweared that they could. Then said he, because the <hi>Canonist</hi> hath bene so deeply charged, we wil begin with tiths which he is reproued for omitting. Thē the <hi>Canonist</hi> said, that they might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed vpon according to the seuerall lawes vnder the title of prohibitiō. That title thē said <hi>Nomomat.</hi> shalbe the first: the second of actions vpō the case: the third of debts, the fourth of accounts, the fift of wast, the sixth of parceners, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of cōditions, wherfore bend your selues wholly to this taske, and let these things be diligently searched &amp; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of you, and for this purpose take the deliberation of twentie daies: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had, and the twentie daies being run out, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> did thus parle with <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologus.</hi>

Waste may bee committed in the decay or demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an house:<note place="margin">3 The cōmon law agreeth with the ciuil that wast may be in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of an house.</note> this likewise is waste by our law; therefore in an action of waste, 42. E. 3. the declaration was that the tenant had done wast in certain tenements demised vnto him by the predecessor of the plaintife for tearme of life, and the wast was assigned to bee in a chamber, a furnace, and a graunge: and the defendant said, that there was no chamber at the time of the lease made: but by the opinion of <hi>Cand.</hi> hee ought to haue said (nor at any time after) wherefore so hee did<note n="d)" place="margin">42.

And if all the house in such case do happen to fall saue onely the postes, and the termor abateth the postes, this is not waste, because waste must be assigned in a house (or some like tenement) so it is if a house newly edified be abated, which house was neuer couered<note n="ee)" place="margin">40.

And 38. E. 3. waste was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

But if a house become ruinous for default of some couering, at the time of the death of the auncestor, and after the tenant suffereth the house to be more rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the heire may haue an action of wast for the late ruine, which happened after the death of the auncestor<note n="k)" place="margin">2.

Neither is it sufficient in barre of a writ of waste of a house that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant hath built a new house in lieu of that which is fallen, but the defendant must say that it is as much in length, and as much in latitude as the other was, or at least hee must say, that it is as profitable: but when a house is rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and decayed at the time of the lease of it made, and it afterwarde falleth, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant buildeth a newe, it is not necessarie that hee should make an other house of equall longitude or latitude<note n="l)" place="margin">22.

And 33. of Henrie the eight, according to <hi>Mast.

Therefore some scruple may with good reason be made of the case <hi>16. Elizab.</hi> in my Lord <hi>Dyers</hi> reportes, A man leased land for yeares, vppon condition that the lessee should not alien the land to anie person without the assent of the lessour, nor any part of the land, the lessour giueth licence to alien part, and the lessee alieneth the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due without licence, it was adiudged that the lessour may enter notwithstanding the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the condition <hi>ex parte</hi>

And by the opinion of manie, this is good for a moitie by
<pb facs="tcp:2844:209"/> the dispensation of the partie, who might take aduantage of the condition by his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of estate<note n="h)" place="margin">5. Ed. 6. 69.

This was adiudged in the Kinges Bench. But now suppose that the condition doth extende onelie to some particular estates, whether shall the other estates depending bee totallie defeated by the breach of the condition? And surelie our Law is, that the breach of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall defeat no estate, but onelie that whereunto it is annexed. For the case was <hi>3.

<pb facs="tcp:2844:223"/> short and subtill definition, but yet true &amp; sound. <hi>Varro</hi> as great and famous amongst the <hi>Romanes</hi> defineth it to be <hi>interuallum mundi &amp; motus, the space of the world and motion,</hi> a briefe definition and verie nimble, if it be nimbly vnderstood: for by the world he meaneth the course of time, by motion the course of thinges. Others, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> haue defined it a <hi>dimension perceyued by the conuersion of the heauens. Plato,</hi> who of these matters had in his trauayle conference with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> defineth it to be a moueable and chaungeable representation of Eternitie;<note n="c)" place="margin">Plat. in Tim.</note> and truely and aptly doth he tearme it a chaungeable representation or image of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for as <hi>Censorinus</hi> noteth, <hi>Time in regarde of Eternitie, is but a winters day.</hi>

                        <note n="e)" place="margin">Cic. lib. de fin. 4.</note> so that <hi>Plato</hi> his definition hath relation to the cause of time; <hi>Ciceroes</hi> to the persons that make vse of time. <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue left to posteritie many subtill, deepe, and learned discourses of time, but bidding their definitions and disputations fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I will examine and weye the distinct partes of time with a popular ballance, and according to common sence, taking that course to be most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2844:223"/> sutable to my profession. The partes of time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the generall diuision of Nations are a yeare, a moneth, a day, an howre, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the <hi>Olympiads</hi> and <hi>Lustra,</hi> as being proper to the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this Treatise, and <hi>Seculum</hi> as being a thing not vsuall in law, which now we handle must likewise be cassierd. Yet in speaking of time we may not forget to handle the circumstances of time as they be accommodated to the Law, and to the actions of men: As namely of a long time, a short time, a late time, an auncient time, a certaine time, an vncertaine time, a continuall time, a conuenient time, time past, time present, and time future. But first to speake of the yeare, <hi>Annus</hi> according to the Etymologie learnedly searched out by <hi>Varro,</hi> is nothing els but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: for as the little circles are called <hi>annuli,</hi> ringes; so the great circles or compasses of time are called <hi>Anni,</hi> yeares<note n="f)" place="margin">Var. lib. 5. de lingu. lat.</note>. The yeare is a time, wherein the Sunne perfitteth his course, and that is accomplished in the space of three hundred, three scoore, and fiue dayes, and sixe howres al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most: And this hath our Law well obserued, as may appeare by these verses:
<q>
                           <l>Ter centum, ter viginti, cum quinque diebus,</l>
                           <l>Sex horas, neque plus integer annus habet<note n="g)" place="margin">18. Elizab. 345. Dyer.</note>.</l>
                        </q> by which accompt (if you subtract the howers and halfe dayes) the quarter of the yeare will fall out as it is in our Law set downe, to be nintie and
<pb facs="tcp:2844:224"/> one dayes; and the halfe yeare, a hundred eightie and two dayes,<note n="h)" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> which was almost fully signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Ianus</hi> his image in <hi>Rome,</hi> in whose right hand was the number of three hundred, and in his left hand fiftie and fiue.<note n="i)" place="margin">Macrob. lib. 1. Stur. ca. 9.</note> Others haue made the same difference betwixt the yeare and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth which the Merchants of some Countries make betwixt the ounce and the pound, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their conceit in this verse:
<q>Vncia{que} in libra pars est, quae mensis in anno.</q> And though it be a common receiued opinion, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> at the first, and a long time after the foundation of their Citie did accompt but tenne monethes for the yeare, so that <hi>Ouid</hi> quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with <hi>Romulus</hi> his Astronomy in this maner:<note n="k)" place="margin">Ouid. lib. 1. fastor.</note>
                        <q>Scilicet arma magis quàm sydera Romule noras.</q> Yet if the course &amp; circumduction of their yeare be well obserued, it will appeare to haue contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the full space of twelue monethes, as may appeare by <hi>Plinie</hi>
                        <note n="l)" place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. ca. 9.</note>, <hi>Macrobius</hi>

                        <note n="n)" place="margin">Plut. in Num.</note>. And this was likewise the yeare of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Romanes</hi> did begin their vulgar yeare at the beginning of Winter, as appeareth by <hi>Ouid:</hi>
                        <q>Bruma noui prima est veterisquè nouissima solis.</q> Which course seemeth to bee agreeable to the course of nature, because then the sunne begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to returne vnto vs, and therefore wee may rightly deriue the beginning of his circuite from thence: The yeare is diuided into the Spring, Summer, Haruest, &amp; Winter. The Romaines did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2844:224"/> accompt the spring that space of time which was betwixt the Calends of March &amp; the Calends of May,<note n="o)" place="margin">Liuy. lib. 34.</note> but the most common &amp; currant entrance of the spring in the reputation of all the nations of the world, was when the plants or herbage of the earth began to waxe greene: and therefore it is rightly tearmed <hi>ver a virendo,</hi> as sommer is called <hi>aeslas ab aestu,</hi> and then is said to begin when heate beginneth.<note n="p)" place="margin">Tacit. de mor. Germ.</note> The name of Autumne nor the thing it selfe (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteh) was not knowne to the Germaines in his time, and diuers countries haue made diuers limitations of the spring, and therefore if it bee agreed betwixt <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Seius</hi> that the beasts of <hi>Titius</hi> shal pasture in the groūds of <hi>Seius</hi> all the spring time, the time shall be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the dimension of the spring-tide in that countrey where the bargaine was made: and so it may be said of the other times, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeare, and if the occupation of a mans ground be granted to <hi>Titius, Seius, Caius,</hi> and <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi> so that <hi>Titius</hi> shall haue the occupation of the land in the spring time, <hi>Seius</hi> in sommer, <hi>Caius</hi> in winter, <hi>Sempronius</hi> in haruest, if the interest of any of the same come in question, the Iudge had need be well aduised of the certaintie, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar difference of these times according to the customarie obseruation of the countrey in which the grant was made, that he may <hi>suū cuique tribue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> and giue no erroneous iudgement.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2844:225"/> vpon good reason if we respect the yeare in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall not in particular; for in the spring time the Sunne mounting to the toppe of one of the lines of the Equinoctial circle he commeth by degrees nearer vnto vs and so maketh summer, but in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest he transcēdeth the other line of the Aequator and so being farre remoued from vs causeth win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore not amisse by the cause of heat and cold, are the times of heate and cold distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>

And it is well said of <hi>D.

Fifthly, because <hi>Primogenitura</hi> is an insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incident to the eldest sonne, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is claymed by this, must bee claymed by
